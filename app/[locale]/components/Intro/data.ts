		"Matrixages drew inspiration from The Matrix and Kevin Kelly's Out of Control. The artistic achievements of humans in architecture are gradually fading, and we no longer marvel at the greatness of art in reality, but are instead fascinated by images on our phone screens. The limited resources of the real world are gradually becoming insufficient to support human desires and ambitions, while the virtual world has no boundaries - we are inevitably moving towards virtualization. Who will build this virtualized world? Who will create the art of the virtual world? This is the question I have been pondering.",
		'Matrixages is dedicated to creating art in the virtual world. We take good ideas and designs from the real world and project them into the virtual world, allowing people to feel what beauty is. We hope that this beauty will change their perception of life, guide them to explore their inner thoughts, release their souls from their bodies, and experience the joys and sorrows of the world, rather than getting lost in happiness.',
		'So I have been trying to integrate my ideas about design, practical experience with advanced technology, and understanding of applications to create a unique product that describes a beautiful future.',
		'This future is a fusion trend of design, open source, collaborative construction, sharing, freedom, and virtualization. Matrixages is my vision for the future, a response to reality, a reflection on the past, and my view of myself - the unity of knowledge and action.',

		'Matrixages的灵感来源于《黑客帝国》和凯文·凯利的《失控》。人类在建筑上的艺术成就色彩渐渐暗淡，我们不再感叹于现实中艺术的伟大，却对手机屏幕上影像如痴如醉。现实世界有限的资源渐渐不足以支撑人类的欲望和野心，而虚拟世界没有边界——我们不可避免地走向虚拟化。那谁来建设这个虚拟化的世界？谁来构建虚拟世界的艺术？这是我一直在思考的问题。',
		'Matrixages致力于做虚拟世界的艺术。把现实世界中的好的思想，好的设计，投射到虚拟世界当中，让人们感受到，什么是美？让这种美去改变他们对于生活的认知，去指引他们探寻内心深处的想法，把自己的灵魂从肉体中释放出来，去感受这世界的喜怒哀乐，而不是在快乐中沉沦。',
		'所以我试图去把自己关于设计的想法、对先进技术的实践以及对于应用的认知融合到一起，打造成独一无二的产品，去描述一种，美好的未来。',
		'这种未来是关于设计、开源、共建、分享、自由、虚拟化的融合趋势，而Matrixages是我对于未来的畅想，对于现实的回应，对于过去的反思，以及关于我对于自己的看法——知行合一。',
